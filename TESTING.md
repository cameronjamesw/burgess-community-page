# Introduction

Throughout the process of creating the Burgess Community Page, I have been conducting tests within each section and function/model. I have mainly been testing for functionality and styling issues, whilst keeping an open eye for any other issues that may pop up. Along with myself performing manual tests, I have also had an array of users, family and friends, testing the website for optimal functionality.

# Manual Testing

# User

# Bugs

- The first bug that I have encountered is within the authentication process. The user is required to sign up with an email, and in doing so an email verification link is sent to the email in question. However, no link is being sent to the user. The current work around that I have for this is that the link for verify the email is being sent to the console, and it is acessissible that way. I have also altered the verification settings so that the user does not need to have their email verified in order for them to log in.
